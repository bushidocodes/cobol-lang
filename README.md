# COBOL Samples

This repo was built researching the COBOL language while writing [this blog post](https://www.bushido.codes/cobol-lang)

I suggest running the samples using the GnuCOBOL computer, which can be installed on a Debian-based system using

```
sudo apt-get install open-cobol
```

The source files can be compiled used `cobc -xj -free myfile.cob`
